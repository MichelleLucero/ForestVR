# Outline for ForestVR
Instructions:
 - Clone ForestVR
 - Go to Unity Hub and click on "ADD"
 - Locate ForestVR
    - Make sure you go into ForestVR/ForestVR (Sorry I should have gave it a different name)
  - Open the project in Unity Hub
    - If you see an empty scene, go to "Assets", click on the "Scenes" folder, then open "SampleScene"
 Note: If your Unity version is different than mine, you'll either get a "downgrade" or "upgrade" warning. Just click it.
